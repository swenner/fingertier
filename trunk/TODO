TODO:
  * create psyeudo random and a sorted playlist files on startup (or demand)
  * save playlist as efficient file (just the paths?)
  * implement saving of the configuration
  * player should pause on call
  * player should prevent the phone from sleeping while playing
  * 'Aux' button should play next song if phone is locked (dbus)
  * library creation progress bar. GUI should never get locked.
  * Is the GIO dependency really neccessary?

Ideas:
  * EFL GUI
  * Clutter GUI
